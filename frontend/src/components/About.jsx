            In recent years, mental health issues have been increasingly recognized as a global crisis affecting people of all ages, particularly young adults and students. Here are some key trends driving the urgency of mental health support:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increase in Anxiety and Depression:</strong> Rising cases, especially among young adults due to academic, financial, and social pressures.</li>
            <li><strong>Pandemicâ€™s Impact:</strong> Social isolation and remote lifestyles have worsened loneliness and stress levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Stigma in Seeking Help:</strong> Many avoid mental health support due to societal stigma and privacy concerns.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Access & High Costs:</strong> Shortage of professionals and expensive therapy make support inaccessible for many.</li>
            <li><strong>Demand for 24/7 Support:</strong> People need on-demand mental health assistance, not confined to office hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
